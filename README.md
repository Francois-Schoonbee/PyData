# Repository for Python for Data Science

## Overview

The repository contains all the exercises and coding I do for the module Python for Data Science at Esade. In each class (or session) we do various exercises and we receive homework. All the code done these sessions are in the **Sessions Exercises** folder. This folder then contains a folder for each session with a python file, README file and any datasets neccesary. 

## Session Exercises

In each session we cover a topic, illustrate some simple examples and then do an exercise of some more complex examples. Here is a short overview of what was done is each session:
- Session 1: Python fundamentals
- Session 2: Python functions
- Session 3: Object Oriented Programming
- Session 4: Data Annotation and Preprocessing
- Session 5: Different formats and basic libraries
- Session 6: Pandas package
- Session 7: Lambdas and Map functions
- Session 8: Plotting using Matplotlib and Seaborn
