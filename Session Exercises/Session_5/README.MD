# Session 5 - Data Science and Machine Learning Foundations

## Overview
In this session, we cover the foundations of **Machine Learning (ML)**, focusing on understanding and implementing some basic ML algorithms. The session aims to help you gain hands-on experience in preparing data, training models, and evaluating their performance.

## Contents
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Steps to load and inspect datasets to understand the features and structure of data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Model Training**: Introduction to basic machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and decision trees.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Techniques for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
To complete this session, **download the `Session_4.zip` file**, which includes all the necessary data annotations. Extract the zip file in the same directory as the notebook to ensure that all data files load without issues.

### Libraries Needed
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib**

If you need to install any missing libraries, use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
