# Session 4 - Python for Data Science

## Overview
This notebook focuses on **Data Annotation and Preprocessing**. The objective of this session is to guide you through loading, annotating, and preprocessing data to prepare it for further analysis or model training. We also cover key Python libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **matplotlib** for handling and visualizing datasets.

## Contents
1. **Loading Data**: Methods for loading datasets in various formats.
2. **Annotation**: Guide on applying and interpreting data annotations.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
4. **Visualization**: Basic data visualization using `matplotlib` to identify trends and outliers.

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, make sure to download the **Session_4.zip** file containing the annotations needed for the exercises. Unzip it into the same directory as the notebook so that all the data files load correctly.

### Libraries Needed
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **matplotlib**

To install any missing libraries, use:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
