# Session 8

## Overview

In this lesson we did the basics of plotting in Python. We learned how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Matplotlib

We did the basics of Matplotlib. This included:
- Making a figures
- Manipulating axises
- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Histogram
- Plotting multiple functions
- Subfigures
- Adjusting visuals of plots (size, colour, text etc.)

## Seaborn

In Seaborn there are a little more complex function that can be utilised. These include:
- Colourmap
- Categorical plots
- Replot
- Distrubution plots
- KDE plots
- Box plots
- Violin plots
- FacetGrid
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot

FInally, we finished off with some home exercises. These included: Home exercises. Note that you may need to also use pandas to answer some of the questions. 

1. Create a *lineplot* showing how **Study Time** varies by **Student Name**. Which student has the highest study time?

2. Plot a histogram (*histplot*) of **Grade** and determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.

3. Create an ECDF plot (*ecdfplot*) for **Grade**. What is the percentage of students scoring less than 85?

4. Create a *stripplot* showing **Grade** distribution for each **Course**. Which course has the most spread in grades?

5. Create a *swarmplot* to show the relationship between Gender and **Study Time**. Which gender has a higher average study time?

6. Plot a *pointplot* to show the average **Grade** for each Course. Which course has the highest average grade?
