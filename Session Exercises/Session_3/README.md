# Python for Data Science - Session 3

## Overview
This notebook is focused on the foundational principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, covering the four core pillars: **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**. Through various examples and hands-on exercises, the concepts of classes, objects, and methods are introduced, demonstrating how OOP can enhance code modularity and reusability, particularly in data science contexts.

## Contents
1. **Classes and Objects**: Introduction to defining classes and creating objects, including attributes and methods.
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details to present only essential functionalities.
3. **Inheritance**: Reusing code by deriving specialized classes from base classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to take on multiple forms, making code more flexible.
5. **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to certain attributes and methods to protect data integrity.

## Examples and Exercises
- **Basic Classes**: Defining a `Pet` class with various attributes and methods.
- **Inheritance Example**: Creating specialized `Dog` and `Cat` classes that inherit from the `Pet` class.
- **Encapsulation in Practice**: Demonstrating attribute protection in a `Student` class using underscores to indicate restricted access.
- **Polymorphism Demonstrated**: Overriding methods to show different behaviors across `Dog` and `Cat` objects.

### Hands-on Project
In the final section, the notebook presents a project where you build a **Course Registration System** using OOP. This includes:
1. A `Course` class to manage enrolled students.
2. A `Student` class to handle personal information and courses.
3. A `Registrar` class that integrates courses and students, facilitating course enrollment and student management.

## Usage
This notebook is ideal for those looking to understand and apply OOP principles within Python. It starts with the basics and builds up to more complex interactions among classes, making it suitable for beginners and intermediate Python learners alike.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python syntax and functions.
- Familiarity with lists and dictionaries in Python.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. You can run this notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment supporting `.ipynb` files.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand and apply OOP principles in Python.
- Be able to create and manage classes and objects, using OOP to solve practical problems.
- Develop a foundational Course Registration System demonstrating real-world applications of OOP.

Happy Coding!
