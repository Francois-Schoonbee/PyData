# Python Fundamentals Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook covering fundamental Python programming concepts, designed for beginners and intermediate learners to understand basic Python operations, data structures, control flow, and functions. Each code cell introduces a concept or practice exercise, with topics ranging from basic syntax to loops and functions.

## Contents

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Basic Printing**  
   - Using `print()` to display strings and format text with variables.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**  
   - Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with variables.

3. **Lists**  
   - Creating and accessing elements in lists, with examples that involve university names.

4. **Dictionaries**  
   - Using dictionaries to store and retrieve student data, including names, ages, and grades.

5. **Tuples**  
   - Working with immutable tuples for storing coordinate pairs.

6. **Sets**  
   - Performing set operations like `add`, `discard`, and `union` to manage unique collections.

7. **Conditional Statements**  
   - Implementing `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `match` statements to manage decision-making logic.

8. **Loops**  
   - Utilizing `for` and `while` loops to iterate through ranges or until a condition is met.

9. **Functions**  
   - Defining functions, including examples of greeting functions, mathematical operations, and functions with default parameters.

10. **List Comprehension**  
    - Generating lists using list comprehension to create lists of squares of numbers.

11. **Average Calculation**  
    - Calculating average grades for students using a dictionary to store data.

12. **Simple Calculator**  
    - An interactive function that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
